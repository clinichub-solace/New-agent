    message: "Tested the newly implemented Lab Integration and Insurance Verification endpoints. Lab Integration is working correctly with all endpoints functioning as expected. Successfully tested initializing lab tests, retrieving lab tests, creating lab orders with patient, provider, lab tests, and ICD-10 codes, and retrieving lab orders. Insurance Verification is partially working - insurance card creation and retrieval, prior authorization, and eligibility retrieval endpoints work correctly. However, the eligibility verification endpoint has an issue with the 'valid_until' parameter being set twice, causing a 'multiple values for keyword argument' error. This needs to be fixed to fully support the insurance verification workflow."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Tested the two problematic endpoints as requested: 1) Calendar View endpoint (/api/appointments/calendar) is implemented in the code but still returns a 404 error with the message 'Appointment not found'. Tested with parameters (date=2025-01-15&view=week) and without parameters, both return the same error. 2) Communications Templates endpoint - The initialization endpoint (/api/communications/init-templates) works correctly, but the templates endpoint (/api/communications/templates) still returns a 500 Internal Server Error. Both endpoints need implementation fixes."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Successfully tested the HIPAA and Texas compliant form templates. The /api/forms/templates/init-compliant endpoint correctly creates all four required compliant templates with proper structure and fields. All forms include appropriate signature fields and required legal language. The patient intake form includes comprehensive demographic, emergency contact, and insurance sections. The consent forms have proper informed consent language, and the HIPAA form includes privacy rights and authorization options. All tests passed successfully."

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The frontend is running but has syntax errors in App.js that prevent it from loading properly. The backend API endpoints for all 6 modules (Referrals, Clinical Templates, Quality Measures, Patient Portal, Documents, and Telehealth) are working correctly as previously tested, but the frontend components cannot be accessed due to these errors. The login page loads but authentication does not proceed to the dashboard due to parsing errors in the code. These issues need to be fixed before frontend testing can continue."

    message: "Tested the payroll management system after the date serialization fixes. The POST /api/payroll/periods endpoint now works correctly and successfully creates a pay period. The date serialization issue has been fixed by using datetime objects instead of date objects for MongoDB. The GET /api/payroll/periods endpoint also works correctly and returns the created periods. The payroll calculation endpoint still has an issue, but this is due to the lack of employee time entries in the system, not a date serialization problem. Overall, the date serialization issues have been fixed, and the payroll system is working as expected for the core functionality of creating and retrieving pay periods."

Findings: 1) Patient Portal Access - There is no dedicated Patient Portal or Patient Login functionality in the current implementation. No links or buttons for patient portal access were found in the UI. 2) Add Patient Functionality - The Add Patient button exists in the Patients/EHR module, but there are issues with the form submission. The formData variable is referenced in the handleSubmit function but is not defined in the component scope. 3) eRx Functionality - The eRx card on the dashboard correctly redirects to the Patients module as expected, but there's no dedicated eRx interface. 4) General System Health - The application has authentication working, but there are issues with form handling in the Patients module that need to be addressed."

    message: "Tested the newly implemented payroll management system endpoints. The system is partially implemented. The GET /api/payroll/periods endpoint works correctly and returns an empty array as expected. However, the POST /api/payroll/periods endpoint fails with a 500 Internal Server Error due to a date serialization issue: cannot encode object: datetime.date(2025, 6, 19), of type: <class datetime.date>. This prevents testing the rest of the workflow since we cannot create a pay period. When testing with mock IDs, the other endpoints (POST /api/payroll/calculate/{period_id}, GET /api/payroll/records/{period_id}, GET /api/payroll/paystub/{record_id}, POST /api/payroll/approve/{period_id}, POST /api/payroll/pay/{period_id}) return appropriate 404 or 500 errors indicating the period or record does not exist, which is expected behavior when using mock IDs. The system needs to fix the date serialization issue in the period creation endpoint to enable full testing of the payroll workflow."
