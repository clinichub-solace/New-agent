#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data.

#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The GET /api/auth/synology-status endpoint correctly returns the Synology integration status (enabled: false by default). The POST /api/auth/test-synology endpoint is properly restricted to admin users only and returns appropriate configuration requirements when Synology is not configured. The authentication flow has been enhanced to include auth_source and synology_enabled fields in the login response. The /api/auth/me endpoint correctly includes the new Synology fields (auth_source, synology_sid). The logout functionality properly handles Synology session cleanup. The system gracefully handles the case when Synology is not configured, falling back to local authentication."

RESULTS SUMMARY: ‚úÖ SOAP NOTES FUNCTIONALITY: Core functionality working - POST /api/soap-notes creates SOAP notes successfully, GET /api/soap-notes/encounter/{id} and GET /api/soap-notes/patient/{id} retrieve notes correctly. MISSING: GET all SOAP notes, GET by ID, UPDATE, DELETE endpoints. ‚úÖ E-PRESCRIBING (eRx) FUNCTIONALITY: Fully operational - GET /api/erx/medications returns 2 medications, search and filtering by drug class working, prescription creation working after fixing required fields (status, medication_display, patient_display). Successfully created prescription RX20250815BD2E50. ‚úÖ INVENTORY EDITING: Basic functionality working - POST /api/inventory creates items, GET /api/inventory lists items, POST /api/inventory/{id}/transaction handles IN/OUT transactions. MISSING: GET by ID, PUT/PATCH updates, DELETE, transaction history endpoints. ‚úÖ OPENEMR INTEGRATION STATUS: OpenEMR is connected (status: connected) and functional - GET /api/openemr/status working, GET /api/openemr/patients returns 2 patients. However, direct APIs are sufficient for most functionality (11 patients via direct API vs 2 via OpenEMR). ‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE WORKFLOW: Successfully tested complete clinical workflow - Created patient ‚Üí Created encounter ‚Üí Added SOAP notes ‚Üí Created prescription ‚Üí Updated inventory. All core workflow steps completed successfully. KEY FINDINGS: Core functionality is working but some CRUD endpoints are missing. Prescription creation required field auto-population fix. OpenEMR integration working but may not be required for basic functionality. Direct APIs provide sufficient clinical workflow capabilities. Authentication system working perfectly with admin/admin123 credentials."
