# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The /api/medications endpoint is returning patient medications (from the model at line 1059) instead of the FHIR-compliant medications (from the model at line 710).

Components are defined but have duplicate definitions which could cause runtime errors. Frontend components are calling backend APIs but backend endpoints are not implemented (404 errors). Need to clean up duplicates and ensure proper frontend-backend integration."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of all EHR backend features. Most features are working correctly, including FHIR-compliant patient management, SOAP notes, encounter management, vital signs, allergies, medications, medical history, diagnosis/procedure coding, and patient summary. However, there are two issues that need to be fixed: 1) Invoice creation is failing with a 500 Internal Server Error without detailed error information, and 2) Inventory transaction endpoint is failing with a 422 Unprocessable Entity error because it expects 'item_id' in the request body but the API is designed to take it from the URL path parameter. These should be prioritized for fixing."

    message: "AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED! Added complete login/logout functionality with JWT tokens, role-based access control, and professional login UI. Backend includes secure password hashing (bcrypt), user management endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/logout, /auth/me, /auth/init-admin), and JWT token generation. Frontend includes AuthContext for state management, LoginPage with cosmic theme, ProtectedRoute component for access control, and integration with all existing modules. Fixed frontend compilation errors caused by complex SVG syntax. System now supports secure user authentication and role-based module access. Ready for comprehensive authentication testing."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Successfully tested the authentication system. Fixed a critical error in the backend server.py file (line 13) where it was incorrectly trying to import 'str' from the 'enum' module. After fixing this issue, all authentication endpoints are working correctly. The /auth/init-admin endpoint creates the default admin user with username 'admin' and password 'admin123'. The /auth/login endpoint returns a JWT token and user information. The /auth/me endpoint correctly validates the token and returns the current user information. Protected endpoints require a valid JWT token. Invalid credentials return appropriate error messages. The authentication system is now fully functional."

    message: "Tested the eRx (Electronic Prescribing) system and found a critical issue: there are two different Medication models defined in the code (lines 710 and 1059), causing a conflict. The /api/init-erx-data endpoint works correctly and initializes the medication database with FHIR-compliant medications. However, the /api/medications endpoint is returning patient medications (from the model at line 1059) instead of the FHIR-compliant medications (from the model at line 710). When trying to create a prescription, we get an error: 'generic_name' because it's trying to use the wrong medication model. This needs to be fixed by renaming one of the Medication models to avoid the conflict. The /api/drug-interactions endpoint works correctly."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Retested the eRx (Electronic Prescribing) system after the model name conflict was fixed. The system is now working correctly. The FHIR-compliant Medication model was renamed to FHIRMedication and the database collection was updated from 'medications' to 'fhir_medications'. All endpoints are now functioning properly: initializing eRx data, searching FHIR medications, filtering by drug class, retrieving medication details, creating prescriptions, retrieving patient prescriptions, updating prescription status, and checking drug-drug interactions. The model conflict has been successfully resolved."

    message: "Successfully tested all four new dashboard API endpoints for clinic operations. All endpoints are working correctly and return properly structured data: 1) eRx Patients Dashboard (/api/dashboard/erx-patients) - Returns patients scheduled for today with prescription counts and allergy information, 2) Daily Log Dashboard (/api/dashboard/daily-log) - Returns completed encounters for today with payment status and revenue totals, 3) Patient Queue Dashboard (/api/dashboard/patient-queue) - Returns active encounters with clinic locations and wait times, 4) Pending Payments Dashboard (/api/dashboard/pending-payments) - Returns unpaid/partial invoices with overdue amounts and days. The endpoints provide practical clinic operation views with proper date filtering and financial calculations."

    message: "Successfully tested the enhanced Smart Forms module with all advanced features. All tests passed successfully across all four phases: 1) Medical Templates Initialization - The /api/forms/templates/init endpoint correctly creates all four required medical templates (patient_intake, vital_signs, pain_assessment, discharge_instructions), 2) Enhanced Form Management - Successfully tested form filtering by category, individual form retrieval, form updates, and creating forms from templates, 3) Form Submission & Smart Tags - Verified that smart tags are properly processed and replaced with actual patient data, and FHIR data is correctly generated from form submissions, 4) Submission Management - All submission management endpoints are working correctly, including form-specific submissions, patient submissions, and individual submission details. The Smart Forms system is fully functional with all the requested enhancements."

    message: "Tested the newly requested Scheduling and Patient Communications systems but found that they have not been implemented yet. All endpoints related to these systems returned 404 Not Found errors. The following endpoints need to be implemented: 1) Provider Management: /api/providers (POST/GET), 2) Appointment Scheduling: /api/appointments (POST/GET), /api/appointments/{id}/status (PUT), /api/providers/{id}/schedule (POST), /api/appointments/calendar (GET), 3) Patient Communications: /api/communications/init-templates (POST), /api/communications/templates (GET/POST), /api/communications/send (POST), /api/communications/messages (GET), /api/communications/messages/patient/{id} (GET), /api/communications/messages/{id}/status (PUT). These systems are required for the complete clinic management functionality."
