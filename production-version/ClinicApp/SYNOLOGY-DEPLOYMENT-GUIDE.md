# 🏥 ClinicHub Synology NAS Deployment Instructions

## Pre-configured for your NAS: **192.168.1.5**

Your deployment package has been customized with:
- ✅ NAS IP: 192.168.1.5
- ✅ Backend URL: https://192.168.1.5:8001  
- ✅ Frontend URL: https://192.168.1.5:3000
- ✅ Synology DSM URL: https://192.168.1.5:5001
- ✅ Comprehensive 9,739-line backend included
- ✅ All 25+ medical modules configured

## Step 1: Transfer Files to Your Synology

From your current system, run:
```bash
# Copy deployment package to your Synology
scp /app/clinichub-synology-deployment.tar.gz admin@192.168.1.5:/volume1/docker/
```

## Step 2: SSH into Your Synology and Deploy

```bash
# SSH into your Synology NAS
ssh admin@192.168.1.5

# Extract the deployment package
cd /volume1/docker/
tar -xzf clinichub-synology-deployment.tar.gz
cd /volume1/docker/

# Make deployment script executable
chmod +x deploy-synology.sh

# Run automated deployment
./deploy-synology.sh
```

## Step 3: Access Your ClinicHub System

After deployment completes:

**Frontend**: https://192.168.1.5:3000
**Backend API**: https://192.168.1.5:8001
**Admin Login**: admin / admin123

## Step 4: Initialize Comprehensive Data

Once the system is running, you'll need to initialize the comprehensive data:
