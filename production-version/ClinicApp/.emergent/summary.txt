The previous AI engineer successfully brought the ClinicHub application from a non-functional state to largely operational. Initial efforts resolved critical deployment and login loop issues, including Pydantic schema validation and Docker Compose/network configuration. Once stable, the focus shifted to enhancing modules like Employee Management, Invoicing, Referrals, and Financial Management, adding extensive UI and backend logic. Documentation was consistently updated.

A significant portion of the trajectory involved fixing a regression: the EHR patient module could no longer add patients. This required rewriting the frontend  to correctly use FastAPI's FHIR-compliant endpoints instead of outdated OpenEMR integrations. Subsequent user reports of broken Inventory and SOAP Notes UI led to comprehensive frontend overhauls for these modules. A critical hardcoded IP in the frontend was also fixed. Database data was accidentally wiped once due to Docker volume removal, necessitating re-initialization. Critical  timestamp bugs were found and fixed in SOAP notes and Inventory update logic. The final stages involved a massive frontend overhaul of the entire EHR module to include Vitals, Medications, Allergies, and Prescriptions. The engineer is currently working on ensuring all update endpoints are functional across the entire application.

<product_requirements>
ClinicHub is a self-hosted, modular, intelligent practice management system for Linux/Synology NAS, emphasizing privacy (HIPAA/Texas compliance) and automation via HIPAA-compliant Smart Forms with FHIR export. Its core is a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) system covering patient management, encounters, SOAP notes, vitals, allergies, medications, history, diagnosis, procedures, and eRx, secured with RBAC/JWT authentication. Auxiliary modules include Patient Scheduling, Communications, Lab Integration, Insurance Verification, Referrals, Clinical Templates, Quality Measures, Patient Portal, Document Management, Telehealth, and an in-house payroll. The previous AI engineer restored and activated core medical modules (Patient, Appointments, eRx, Dashboard), ensuring backend stability. The user specifically requested an advanced system where SOAP note completion triggers automatic processes like receipt generation, inventory deduction, and staff activity tracking.

<code_architecture>

-   : The core FastAPI backend, significantly expanded. It now includes comprehensive API endpoints for patient management (FHIR-compliant), employee management, invoicing, referrals, financial transactions, SOAP notes, and vital signs. Recent modifications focused on fixing  and Pydantic validation for admin users. Crucially, it received additions for missing GET/PUT endpoints for SOAP Notes and Inventory, and critical bug fixes to prevent  timestamps from being overwritten during update operations for both SOAP notes and Inventory items.
-   : The main React application file, extensively modified. Initially, it was debugged for  issues, resulting in a temporary hardcoded IP that was later corrected to  with an  timeout. The  was completely rewritten to interact with the correct FHIR-compliant  endpoints and was further enhanced to integrate a comprehensive EHR interface with dedicated tabs for Patient Chart, Vital Signs, Medications (placeholder), Allergies (placeholder), and Prescriptions (placeholder), including a full SOAP Notes UI. The  was also overhauled to provide Add Item and Edit functionalities.
-   : Defines the multi-container setup for the application, including , FastAPI backend, and React frontend. It was frequently updated to ensure correct environment variable passing and robust health checks.
-   : A new, essential document detailing solutions for recurring deployment, network, and Docker issues, serving as a comprehensive debugging guide.
-   , , , , : New backend files providing models and logic for comprehensive features in their respective modules.
-   : A newly created document outlining the plan for advanced EHR features.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Complete comprehensive system update check**: Ensure all modules and endpoints are 100% functional, specifically checking for all remaining CRUD operations.
-   **Implement missing Patient UPDATE endpoint**: This was explicitly identified as the immediate next step.
-   Implement frontend UI for Medications, Allergies, and Prescriptions tabs in the EHR module, currently placeholders.
-   Address minor backend issues: invoice status updates, financial reporting, and lab order creation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive system check, specifically tasked by the user to double check all modules make all endpoints are working and ensure everything is 100%. During this process, a backend test revealed critical issues with several  (PUT) endpoints across the application, which were identified as missing or not working properly. The AI engineer acknowledged this, stating an intent to implement the missing CRUD operations immediately. The last explicit action mentioned was Now let me add the missing Patient UPDATE endpoint:. This indicates that the current work involves systematically implementing and verifying all missing or non-functional PUT/UPDATE endpoints throughout the ClinicHub application, particularly starting with the Patient module, to ensure full CRUD capabilities across all features. This task is a direct response to user feedback about the system not being fully operational.
