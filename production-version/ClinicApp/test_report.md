# EHR and eRx Functionality Test Report

## Summary of Test Results

### EHR Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| /api/patients | GET | ✅ PASSED | Successfully retrieves patient list |
| /api/encounters | GET | ✅ PASSED | Successfully retrieves encounters |
| /api/encounters | POST | ✅ PASSED | Successfully creates a new encounter |
| /api/vital-signs | GET | ❌ FAILED | Method Not Allowed (405) - Endpoint exists but doesn't support GET method |
| /api/medications | GET | ✅ PASSED | Successfully retrieves medications |

### eRx Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| /api/prescriptions | GET | ❌ FAILED | Method Not Allowed (405) - Endpoint exists but doesn't support GET method |
| /api/prescriptions | POST | ✅ PASSED | Successfully creates a prescription |
| /api/erx/medications | GET | ❌ FAILED | Not Found (404) - Endpoint doesn't exist |
| /api/erx/init | POST | ❌ FAILED | Not Found (404) - Endpoint doesn't exist |
| /api/erx/formulary | GET | ❌ FAILED | Not Found (404) - Endpoint doesn't exist |

## Detailed Analysis

### Working Functionality
1. **Patient Management**: The system correctly handles patient data retrieval.
2. **Encounter Management**: Both retrieving and creating encounters work correctly.
3. **Medication Retrieval**: The system can retrieve medication data.
4. **Prescription Creation**: Creating prescriptions works correctly.

### Issues Identified
1. **Vital Signs Retrieval**: The `/api/vital-signs` endpoint exists but doesn't support the GET method. This suggests the endpoint might be implemented but only supports other methods like POST.

2. **Prescription Retrieval**: The `/api/prescriptions` endpoint exists but doesn't support the GET method. This suggests the endpoint might be implemented but only supports other methods like POST.

3. **Missing eRx Endpoints**: The following eRx-specific endpoints are missing:
   - `/api/erx/medications` - For retrieving FHIR medications
   - `/api/erx/init` - For initializing eRx sessions
   - `/api/erx/formulary` - For accessing formulary data

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Missing GET Methods**:
   - Add GET support to `/api/vital-signs` to retrieve vital signs data
   - Add GET support to `/api/prescriptions` to retrieve prescription data

2. **Implement Missing eRx Endpoints**:
   - Create `/api/erx/medications` endpoint for FHIR medication access
   - Create `/api/erx/init` endpoint for eRx session initialization
   - Create `/api/erx/formulary` endpoint for formulary access

3. **Verify Data Flow**:
   - Ensure proper data flow between patient records, encounters, and prescriptions
   - Verify that created prescriptions are properly linked to patients and medications

## Conclusion

The core EHR functionality is mostly working, with patient and encounter management functioning correctly. The prescription creation also works, but there are significant gaps in the eRx functionality, with several endpoints missing entirely. The system needs further development to fully support electronic prescribing workflows according to the requirements.
