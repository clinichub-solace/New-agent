# Test Results Update

Based on the testing of the specified endpoints, here are the findings:

1. **Calendar View Endpoint**:
   - The endpoint `/api/appointments/calendar` is implemented in the code but returns a 404 error with the message "Appointment not found".
   - Tested with parameters (date=2025-01-15&view=week) and without parameters, both return the same error.
   - The endpoint is accessible but has an implementation issue that needs to be fixed.

2. **Communications Templates Endpoint**:
   - The initialization endpoint `/api/communications/init-templates` works correctly.
   - The templates endpoint `/api/communications/templates` still returns a 500 Internal Server Error.
   - This confirms the previous testing results that the templates endpoint has an implementation issue.

These findings should be updated in the test_result.md file.
