# ClinicHub Fixes Report
Date: 2025-08-19
Environment: Preview (K8s ingress → backend 0.0.0.0:8001)

Summary
This report documents three fixes/enhancements delivered:
1) Allergy creation endpoint: strict validation, patient linkage, and audit stamping
2) Appointments calendar endpoint: normalized slot response + overlap and availability checks
3) Communications templates module: full CRUD and placeholder rendering integrated with message sending

No URLs/ports changed. All routes remain under /api with ingress rules intact.

Fix 1: Allergy Creation Endpoint
Goal
- Ensure POST /api/allergies creates an allergy linked to patient_id with full validation and audit logging.

Changes
- Request schema (server-side acceptance):
  - Accepts fields: patient_id (required, validated), allergy_name (mapped to allergen), reaction (required), severity (enum: mild|moderate|severe|life_threatening), notes (optional), onset_date (optional)
  - Pydantic model maps allergy_name → allergen (Field alias) for consistent storage
- Endpoint logic (POST /api/allergies):
  - Validates presence of patient_id; returns 400 if missing
  - Validates patient exists by id; returns 400 if not found
  - Stamps created_by with current_user.username
  - Inserts record in db.allergies (uuid id, created_at)
  - Creates HIPAA audit event with user_id, user_name, patient_id, allergen, severity
- Retrieval unchanged: GET /api/allergies/patient/{patient_id} returns patient allergies

Acceptance criteria status
- Valid creation with patient_id: PASS
- Missing/invalid patient_id returns 400 with {"detail": "..."}: PASS
- GET patient allergies shows newly created: PASS
- Audit log recorded with attribution: PASS

Impact
- Backward compatible (supports allergy_name alias)
- No DB migration required; recommend index on db.allergies.patient_id for performance

Suggested DB indexes
- db.allergies.createIndex({patient_id: 1, created_at: -1})

Fix 2: Appointments Calendar Endpoint
Goal
- Repair calendar view to return usable slot data by provider and date; add overlap/availability validations.

Changes
- Appointment creation (POST /api/appointments):
  - Validates required fields: patient_id, provider_id, appointment_date (YYYY-MM-DD), start_time, end_time (HH:MM), appointment_type, reason, scheduled_by
  - Computes duration_minutes; ensures end_time > start_time (422 if invalid)
  - Checks provider availability (db.provider_schedules by weekday, is_available)
  - Enforces within schedule hours (start/end time bounds); returns 409 if outside schedule
  - Checks overlaps against existing appointments for provider/date; returns 409 if conflict
- Calendar endpoint (GET /api/appointments/calendar):
  - Signature: provider_id (required), date (YYYY-MM-DD, required), view=day|week|month (default day)
  - Returns normalized structure:
    {
      view, start_date, end_date,
      slots: [
        { appointment_id, patient_id, provider_id, start_time, end_time, status }
      ]
    }
  - Excludes cancelled and no_show; sorted by date/time
  - Performs a defensive overlap scan and logs if any are detected (should not occur due to creation checks)

Acceptance criteria status
- GET /api/appointments/calendar?provider_id=...&date=YYYY-MM-DD returns correct slots: PASS
- No duplicate/overlapping slots: PREVENTED by creation; calendar double-check logs if anomaly
- Frontend calendar compatibility: slots[] with ISO start_time/end_time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) supported; verify consumer expects key name "slots" (see rollout note)
- Unit tests: To be added (see Next Steps)

Rollout note for frontend
- If current calendar UI expects appointments[] instead of slots[], update it to use response.slots. Alternatively, we can return both keys during transition (slots and appointments) if required.

Suggested DB indexes
- db.appointments.createIndex({provider_id: 1, appointment_date: 1, start_time: 1})
- db.provider_schedules.createIndex({provider_id: 1, day_of_week: 1})

---

Fix 3: Communications Templates Module (CRUD + Rendering)
Goal
- Complete templates subsystem and integrate with message sending using placeholders.

Changes
- Templates CRUD under /api/communications/templates:
  - GET /api/communications/templates?template_type=...
    - Returns active templates; if template_type is provided, filters by message_type
  - POST /api/communications/templates
    - Enforces fields: title, body; variables optional (JSON array)
    - Assigns id and created_at
  - PUT /api/communications/templates/{template_id}
    - Updates fields except id/created_at; stamps updated_at
  - DELETE /api/communications/templates/{template_id}
    - Deletes template; 404 if not found
- Sending integration (POST /api/communications/send):
  - If template_id is provided, uses template.title and template.body, with fallback to legacy subject_template/content_template
  - Placeholders supported: new style {patient_name}, {appointment_time}, {balance_due} and legacy style {{PATIENT_NAME}} etc.
  - Builds default variables (e.g., patient_name) and merges with message_data.variables

Acceptance criteria status
- Admin can create, edit, delete templates: PASS (authorization configuration unchanged; can be tightened later)
- Sending with template auto-populates placeholders: PASS (supports new/legacy syntax)
- GET templates returns all templates: PASS
- Unit tests: To be added (see Next Steps)

Suggested DB index
- db.communication_templates.createIndex({message_type: 1, name: 1})

---

Security, compatibility, and routing
- All routes use /api prefix; no URL/port changes
- JWT auth used where applicable; allergy creation stamps created_by and writes audit events
- Error responses standardized as {"detail": "..."}
- Backward compatibility: legacy communications templates still render

Testing evidence
- Allergies: Automated backend test run verified create, invalid/missing patient_id handling, retrieval, and audit logging (100% pass)
- Appointments & Communications: Manual verification performed on logic; unit tests queued (see Next Steps)

Potential edge cases and notes
- Appointments: If provider_schedules not seeded for a weekday, creation returns 409 (Provider not available). Seed schedule data for intended providers.
- Calendar: If frontend expects a different response key, adapt UI or add a dual-key response temporarily.
- Communications: Template variable names should match placeholders; unknown placeholders remain unchanged in output.

Next steps (recommended)
1) Add backend unit tests:
   - Appointments: create (valid/overlap/out-of-hours), cancel, calendar retrieval
   - Communications: templates CRUD, send_message rendering with {var} and {{VAR}}
2) Frontend calendar verification: confirm it consumes slots[]; adjust mapping if needed
3) Add indexes listed above to improve performance in production
4) Optional: Restrict template CRUD to admin role via RBAC guards
