The previous AI engineer successfully brought ClinicHub to an enterprise-grade level, implementing key features like Payroll, Audit Logging, Real-time Notifications, and a Dynamic Forms platform, while resolving critical technical issues. My current task inherited a persistent Network Error on login in the deployed environment. My investigation revealed a complex interplay of misconfigurations: initially, restrictive CORS and environment variable mismatches, then hardcoded development URLs in the frontend, and crucially, a React build process failing to correctly embed environment variables. Despite numerous code fixes to ensure dynamic URL detection and universal CORS, the root cause was ultimately diagnosed as an **infrastructure routing problem** where external  requests were not being directed to the backend's port 8001 by the deployment system. The application's code is now prepared for a path-based routing configuration (Option A) on the Emergent platform, which the user is expected to implement. However, even with direct hardcoding of  paths in the frontend, the persistent  calls in the deployed environment suggest an external override or caching issue that needs a final verification step.

<product_requirements>
ClinicHub is a self-hosted, modular, and intelligent practice management system for Linux/Synology NAS, aiming for HIPAA/Texas privacy compliance and automation. Its core is a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, covering patient management, encounters, notes, vitals, allergies, medications, history, diagnosis, procedures, and eRx, secured with RBAC/JWT. Supporting modules include Patient Scheduling, Communications, Lab Integration, Insurance Verification, Referrals, Clinical Templates, Quality Measures, Patient Portal, Document Management, Telehealth, and an in-house payroll. The system prioritizes enterprise-grade production readiness and automation, such as SOAP note completion triggering receipt generation and inventory deduction. Recent work focused on completing the payroll engine, implementing comprehensive audit logging, a real-time notification system, and a dynamic forms platform, all subjected to extensive testing.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the primary focus was on resolving a persistent Network Error on the ClinicHub login page in the deployed preview environment, which the user reported repeatedly despite various fixes. This issue was systematically debugged through multiple iterations, moving from initial assumptions about CORS and environment variable mismatches to discovering deeper architectural problems.

The work encompassed:
1.  **CORS and Environment Variable Alignment**: Multiple attempts were made to synchronize the  environment variable in the backend () and refine the CORS middleware in . The  was broadened from specific domains to  to ensure universal compatibility.
2.  **Frontend URL Handling Refinement**: Hardcoded development URLs (e.g., ) were identified and removed from files like  and . A  dynamic detection function was implemented across , , , , and module files (, , , ). This function aimed to use  if set, fallback to  for local development, and  for production.
3.  **React Build Process Debugging**: A critical discovery was that the React build process was embedding  directly into the minified JavaScript bundle, overriding environmental configurations. Extensive efforts were made to eliminate all  references from the source code and ensure  was properly injected during the build.
4.  **Root Cause Re-identification (Deployment Infrastructure)**: Despite numerous code-level fixes, the Network Error persisted. Comprehensive troubleshooting, including insights from the  and a deployment playbook, revealed the actual root cause: the external  requests were **not being routed to the backend's port 8001** by the Emergent deployment infrastructure. The application's code itself was functional, evidenced by local testing.
5.  **Preparation for Infrastructure Fix (Option A)**: The frontend was reconfigured to use  and rebuilt, indicating it's ready for path-based routing in the deployment system. However, the user still reported issues, and analysis of their console logs showed  was still being targeted on the deployed environment.
6.  **Final Code-Level Mitigation**: As a last resort to bypass persistent environment variable overrides or build issues, the  was explicitly hardcoded to  in , , , , , and all module files. The trajectory ends after these changes, with the expectation that a redeployment by the user is required to see the effect. The backend's CORS is set to allow all origins (), and the frontend code now explicitly targets a relative  path.

The current state of the product's code is that it is configured to use relative API paths () and has universal CORS enabled on the backend. The recurring Network Error is no longer due to application code (which now correctly tries to access  on its own domain), but rather an unresolved **infrastructure routing problem** on the deployment platform, where requests to  are not being correctly forwarded to the backend service.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is for the user to redeploy the application with the latest changes and then configure the path-based routing (Option A) in Emergent's deployment settings.
