The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned ClinicHub from MVP to a functional system, focusing on resolving environment and compilation issues. A key task was restoring a most advanced comprehensive system, including a 9,739-line backend and rich frontend UI on Ubuntu. The primary recent task shifted to deploying this comprehensive system to a Synology NAS. This involved extensive debugging of  file transfer issues, re-creating deployment configurations directly on Synology, resolving a MongoDB AVX CPU compatibility problem by downgrading to Mongo 4.4, and fixing persistent frontend Docker build errors related to yarn install v1.22.22

<product_requirements>
ClinicHub is envisioned as a self-hosted, modular, and intelligent practice management system for Linux/Synology NAS, prioritizing privacy and automation. It requires HTTPS and HIPAA/Texas compliant Smart Forms with FHIR export. Its core is a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) system covering patient management, encounters, SOAP notes, vitals, allergies, medications, medical history, diagnosis, procedures, and eRx, secured with RBAC/JWT. Implemented features include Patient Scheduling, Patient Communications, Lab Integration, Insurance Verification, Referrals Management, Clinical Templates & Protocols, Quality Measures & Reporting, Patient Portal, Document Management System, Telehealth Module, and an in-house payroll system. The current work has focused on enabling core medical modules (Patient, Appointments, eRx, Dashboard) interactively, resolving local deployment challenges, and backend stability for complex features. The user desires the restoration of an advanced, interconnected system where actions like SOAP notes automatically trigger receipt generation, inventory deduction, and staff tracking, and then deploying this system to their Synology NAS.

- : The core FastAPI backend logic. Initially 790 lines, a 9,739-line comprehensive version exists (from ). The current  version being debugged is 790 lines. The latest modification attempt involved fixing an  on line 21 from  to .
- : Main React component for routing and UI. It was modularized to support a comprehensive dashboard despite its smaller line count (170 lines in one state). The  version has faced build issues, leading to  modifications.
- : Defines multi-container application. Repeatedly modified for Synology deployment, including MongoDB image (from 7.0 to 4.4 and then back to 7.0 as per  repo), Python backend image (slim to bullseye), and environment variables ().
- : Configured for backend container build. Modified to change base Python image and install system dependencies for package compilation.
- : Configured for frontend container build. Underwent multiple iterations to resolve yarn install v1.22.22

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in deploying the  repository to the user's Synology NAS at . The process had been challenging due to issues like  transfer failures, discrepancies in local vs. container file paths, and Docker build/runtime errors.

The current state of the Synology deployment for  is:
- **MongoDB (mongo:7.0)**: Running, but previously showed AVX compatibility warnings on the user's Synology hardware (though it appears to start currently).
- **Frontend Container**: The Docker build for the React frontend was encountering persistent issues related to / conflicts and  module errors when trying  or yarn run v1.22.22

- **Backend Container**: The backend was  (crashing). The latest identified error from  (Chat 232) was  for  in  line 21. The AI engineer had provided a  command to change this to  to fix it.

The user then pivoted from troubleshooting, asking to check all forked sessions for the most adavanced version of each module, which interrupts the current fix and indicates a desire to consolidate efforts.

<optional_next_step>
Propose a plan to consolidate the most advanced features and modules from our current session's work into the  repository for its full deployment on Synology.
