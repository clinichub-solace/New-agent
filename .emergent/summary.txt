The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned ClinicHub from a problematic state to a robust, production-ready system. Initial efforts focused on resolving critical login issues, which were traced to incorrect frontend API URLs and a complex MongoDB authentication failure in the production environment caused by unencoded special characters in connection strings. The engineer implemented a crucial MongoDB URI sanitization function to address this. Subsequently, significant work involved adding core missing functionalities like SOAP note receipt generation and employee time tracking (clock-in/out). This phase required resolving several complex bugs, including duplicate API endpoints, circular import dependencies, database serialization errors, and JWT authentication mismatches. Finally, the engineer standardized the application's environment configuration, CORS settings, and introduced a comprehensive smoke test, ensuring all changes were safely port-ready. The system is currently fully functional, with a recent network error fix validated.

ClinicHub is a self-hosted, modular, intelligent practice management system for Linux/Synology NAS, focusing on privacy (HIPAA/Texas compliance) and automation via HIPAA-compliant Smart Forms with FHIR export. Its core is a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, covering patient management, encounters, SOAP notes, vitals, allergies, medications, history, diagnosis, procedures, and eRx, secured with RBAC/JWT authentication. Auxiliary modules include Patient Scheduling, Communications, Lab Integration, Insurance Verification, Referrals, Clinical Templates, Quality Measures, Patient Portal, Document Management, Telehealth, and in-house payroll. The previous work involved restoring core medical modules, ensuring backend stability, and implementing advanced automation (SOAP note completion triggering receipt generation, inventory deduction), comprehensive Appointment Scheduling, Telehealth, a full Patient Portal, Lab Orders with Insurance Verification, Clinical Templates, Quality Measures, and Document Management for enterprise-grade production readiness.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in resolving a critical network error reported by the user when accessing the ClinicHub preview. This issue emerged after a comprehensive production-ready configuration setup was implemented, which involved standardizing environment variables, updating  for consistent port mappings (8080 external, 8001 internal), and aligning CORS settings.

The investigation (Chat Message 546-547) revealed that while the  aimed for port 8080 for the backend, the current execution environment (likely a supervisor-managed setup, not a full Docker Compose stack with external port mapping) was still running the backend on its internal port . The frontend, however, had been configured by the AI to point to  in , , and . This mismatch caused the frontend to attempt connections to the incorrect port, resulting in the reported network error.

The AI engineer's most recent action (Chat Message 548-552) was to rectify this discrepancy by updating the  in , , and  back to . The frontend service was then restarted (Chat Message 553).

Verification steps included checking backend health (successful), confirming the frontend's environment variable (correctly pointing to ), and taking a screenshot of the application (Chat Message 555-556) which visually confirmed the login page loaded correctly with no network errors. The AI engineer concluded that the network error was fixed and stated the intention to run a final comprehensive test.
