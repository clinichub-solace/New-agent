The AI engineer successfully initiated and developed ClinicHub, a comprehensive medical practice management system, from scratch. The initial phase focused on understanding the broad requirements, prioritizing core modules over AI integration, and ensuring FHIR compliance. Development proceeded iteratively, with the AI engineer building foundational components, then expanding into specific modules like EHR, Smart Forms, Inventory, Employee Management, and Finance, followed by implementing a login page and role-based access control. Each major feature was followed by a detailed summary and a prompt for the next steps or testing. The approach prioritized maximum value first, delivering core functionalities before addressing advanced features or external integrations (like AI). The work consistently involved backend API development (FastAPI, MongoDB) and frontend UI implementation (React, Tailwind CSS). The last major task, authentication and role-based access, is currently in progress, specifically facing frontend compilation errors.

<current_work>
The immediate work being done is the implementation of the login page and role-based access control.
**Backend progress:** The AI engineer successfully added backend models for  and , implemented password hashing, JWT token generation, and created authentication API routes (, ). Necessary libraries were confirmed to be in .
**Frontend progress:** The AI engineer attempted to implement the login system and authentication context on the frontend. This involved creating an  and  to wrap the application, managing user authentication state, and conditional rendering based on login status in . Attempts were also made to integrate logout functionality and user information into the  component.

**Current State and Nuances:**
The backend components for authentication appear to be in place. However, the frontend implementation is currently experiencing compilation errors. This means the code written for the frontend, specifically around  and potentially  or new authentication-related components, is preventing the application from compiling and running correctly. The exact nature of these compilation errors needs to be identified and resolved to make the login page functional. The last action indicates the AI engineer recognized the compilation errors and intends to fix them step by step.
