The previous AI engineer successfully brought the ClinicHub application from a non-functional state to a largely operational one. Initial efforts focused on resolving critical deployment and runtime issues, particularly a persistent login loop caused by Pydantic schema validation errors for existing admin users. This involved direct modifications to backend authentication logic in  and extensive troubleshooting of Docker Compose configurations, network connectivity (resolving  versus Alpine container IP issues), frontend environment variable loading, and Docker build cache problems, often requiring aggressive rebuilds and disk cleanup.

Once core functionality and login were stable, the focus shifted to enhancing specific modules. The AI engineer made significant progress on Employee Management, Invoicing, Referrals, and Financial Management, adding comprehensive UI and backend logic, including complex integrations like inventory deduction for invoices and detailed financial reporting. Documentation (, ) was updated based on real-world debugging. The current work is now fixing a regression: the EHR patient module, which was previously working, is reported by the user as no longer allowing patient additions.

<product_requirements>
ClinicHub is envisioned as a self-hosted, modular, and intelligent practice management system, designed for Linux/Synology NAS environments. It emphasizes privacy (HIPAA/Texas compliance) and automation, offering HIPAA-compliant Smart Forms with FHIR export. Its core is a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) system covering patient management, encounters, SOAP notes, vitals, allergies, medications, history, diagnosis, procedures, and eRx, secured with RBAC/JWT authentication.

Beyond EHR, the application includes modules for Patient Scheduling, Communications, Lab Integration, Insurance Verification, Referrals, Clinical Templates, Quality Measures, Patient Portal, Document Management, Telehealth, and an in-house payroll. The previous AI engineer's work restored and activated core medical modules (Patient, Appointments, eRx, Dashboard) and resolved local deployment issues to ensure backend stability for advanced features. The user specifically requested restoring an advanced system where actions like SOAP note completion automatically trigger processes such as receipt generation, inventory deduction, and staff activity tracking.

- : Core FastAPI backend. It was expanded from a simple version to a comprehensive one. Key modifications include fixing , adding API endpoints (e.g., ), resolving Pydantic  for , and crucially, modifying  and  functions to handle / Pydantic validation for existing users. A root  endpoint was added to return a JSON response, resolving 404 errors. CORS configuration was also verified.
- : Main React component for routing and UI. It was updated to a comprehensive dashboard integrating various modules. Crucially, its  environment variable usage was debugged repeatedly, leading to a temporary hardcoding of the backend URL (e.g., ) to ensure correct API calls due to persistent environment variable loading issues. It has received significant UI additions for Employee, Invoices, Referrals, and Finance modules.
- : Defines the multi-container setup. Modified to use , configure backend (), and set up robust health checks with extended  and . It was frequently updated to correctly pass  to the frontend and was modified to force frontend container rebuilds ().
-  & : Environment variable files.  was configured with  and .  (and , a newly created file) were repeatedly updated to ensure  points to the correct external IP (e.g., ), resolving  and  issues during frontend-backend communication.
- : **Newly created file**. This critical document now captures the detailed solutions for recurring deployment and operational issues encountered, such as login loops, network errors, Docker build cache problems, disk space issues, Git merge conflicts, and service health check misconfigurations. It serves as a comprehensive guide for future debugging.
- : Existing setup guide. It was updated to incorporate lessons learned from the extensive debugging process, including nuclear rebuild options and improved verification steps, making the initial setup more robust.
- , : **Newly created** for the comprehensive EHR system. They outline the plan and backend models for advanced EHR features like lab order workflows, critical value alerts, preventive care reminders, clinical decision support, family/social history, and pediatric support.
- , : **Newly created** to complete the Employee Management module. They provide backend models and a plan for features like comprehensive payroll calculations (tax engine, deductions), professional paystub generation, check printing integration, and enhanced provider scheduling.
- : **Newly created** to support the comprehensive Invoicing module. This file contains backend logic for detailed invoice management, payment processing, automatic inventory deduction upon payment, and integration with SOAP notes for invoice generation.
- : **Newly created** to support the comprehensive Referrals Management module. This file holds backend logic for managing referral lifecycles, specialist networks, professional letter generation, and appointment coordination.
- : **Newly created** to support the comprehensive Financial Management module. This file includes backend models for a financial dashboard, Profit & Loss statements, Balance Sheets, budget management, and comprehensive transaction management.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had just completed the comprehensive implementation of the Finance module (Chat 260), transforming it into an enterprise-level financial management system with real-time KPIs, P&L, Balance Sheet, Budget Management, and Transaction Management. The module was declared production-ready.

However, directly following this completion, the user reported a critical regression: check ehr and everything it was working fine but now i cant add patients or anything (Chat 261). This indicates that the previously functional EHR system (Patient/EHR Management, which was assessed as 80% complete and Production Ready in Chat 164, and later refined as 85% complete in Chat 170) is now broken regarding core patient functionality.

The AI engineer acknowledged this as a CRITICAL BUG - EHR Patient Module Broken! (Chat 263) and is preparing to investigate and fix it. This task has just begun, with the immediate goal being to diagnose the root cause of why patient addition and other EHR functionalities are no longer working. The product is currently in a state where several core modules (Auth, Employee Management, Invoicing, Referrals, Finance) have received comprehensive updates, but a critical regression has appeared in the EHR system, impacting fundamental patient data management.
