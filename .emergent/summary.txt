The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized ClinicHub, resolving critical network and MongoDB authentication issues by standardizing environment variables, correcting API URL configurations, and implementing URI sanitization. Following this, the engineer focused on enhancing core functionalities. Key additions included robust backend modules for Allergy management, comprehensive Appointments and Calendar views with conflict detection, and a Communications module with template support. Significant effort was then directed towards completing the Insurance Verification workflow with a mock adapter and laying the groundwork for Quality Measures and Reporting. The most recent and extensive work involved building a full-fledged Payroll engine, encompassing calculations, paystub/check generation, tax handling, direct deposit, and ACH exports, ensuring idempotency and full financial integration.

<product_requirements>
ClinicHub is designed as a self-hosted, modular, and intelligent practice management system for Linux/Synology NAS, prioritizing HIPAA/Texas privacy compliance and automation. Its core functionality is a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, featuring patient management, encounters, SOAP notes, vitals, allergies, medications, history, diagnosis, procedures, and eRx, secured with RBAC/JWT. Auxiliary modules include Patient Scheduling, Communications, Lab Integration, Insurance Verification, Referrals, Clinical Templates, Quality Measures, Patient Portal, Document Management, Telehealth, and in-house payroll. The system aims for enterprise-grade production readiness, with implemented automations like SOAP note completion triggering receipt generation and inventory deduction, robust appointment scheduling, and foundational Patient Portal and Lab Order capabilities. Recent work expanded on missing features and addressed bugs in existing modules.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was completing the comprehensive **Payroll Engine Completion (Task 6)**. This involved a multi-phase implementation:

1.  **Core Payroll Calculation and Outputs (PATCH 6A)**: Initial endpoints for  to compute gross-to-net pay,  to get JSON paystub data,  for basic check records and idempotent finance expense posting,  for retrieving tax data, and  for setting up employee direct deposit information. This logic was primarily added to .

2.  **Router Wiring and Indexing (PATCH 6B)**: The payroll router was integrated into  (). A startup event was added to  to ensure necessary MongoDB indexes for payroll collections (, , , ) are created idempotently.

3.  **Periods and Runs Management (PATCH 6C)**: Endpoints for  (idempotent creation),  (listing, with  filter),  (idempotent creation of DRAFT runs), ,  (aggregating records, marking paid, idempotent finance expense posting, updating run totals, setting status to POSTED),  (marking run VOID), and  (returning JSON array of paystub summaries).

4.  **API Shape Normalization and Test Seeding**: Helper functions (, , ) were implemented in  to ensure consistent API responses (e.g., stable ,  alias). A test-only seeding endpoint () was created in  and conditionally included in  for development/testing environments.

5.  **PDF, Tax Engine, Bank Info, ACH, Exports**:
    *    was added to  and installed.
    *    was created to generate PDF paystubs.
    *   A generic tax engine () and its configuration routes () were added.
    *   Employee bank information management () was implemented.
    *   ACH configuration () and NACHA PPD file generation () were added.
    *   CSV and ACH export endpoints () were implemented.
    *   All new payroll-related routers were registered in .

6.  **Tax Hook Integration**: An async tax computation hook ( in ) was integrated into the  endpoint to compute and persist tax details (taxes, taxable_income, tax_breakdown) per record during posting.

The system is now poised for final backend testing of the fully implemented payroll module.
