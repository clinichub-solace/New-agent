The AI engineer successfully initiated and developed ClinicHub, a comprehensive medical practice management system, from scratch, prioritizing core modules and FHIR compliance. Development was iterative, building foundational components, then expanding into EHR, Smart Forms, Inventory, Employee Management, and Finance modules. Authentication and role-based access control were implemented, resolving initial frontend compilation errors. Subsequent work included implementing eRx functionality, which involved backend model and API changes, and frontend integration within the EHR, resolving model conflicts. The dashboard was then revamped with new operational metrics and corresponding backend APIs and frontend UI updates. The latest task involves adding Patient Scheduling and Patient Communications modules. Backend endpoints for these were attempted, but remain incomplete (404 errors), and frontend components are currently referenced but undefined in , leading to runtime errors, which is the immediate issue being addressed.

<product_requirements>
ClinicHub is envisioned as a self-hosted, modular, and intelligent practice management system for deployment on Synology NAS or Linux, emphasizing privacy, control, and automation.
Key features developed:
1.  **System Foundation:** Docker Compose, auto-setup of core directories, HTTPS configuration.
2.  **Smart Forms:** Drag-and-drop builder, FHIR-compliant export (PDF/JSON/XML), audit trail. Enhanced with additional fields, status, and submission/viewer functionality.
3.  **Electronic Health Record (EHR):** Patient management, encounter tracking, SOAP notes, vitals, allergies, medications, medical history, diagnosis, procedures, patient summaries. Enhanced with document upload (Base64) and eRx (electronic prescribing) capabilities.
4.  **Receipt/Invoice System:** Patient/encounter linking, auto-generated IDs, tax, inventory deduction.
5.  **InventoryLite:** Item tracking, usage logs, categories, stock alerts, auto-deduction.
6.  **Employee Management:** Directory, scheduling, time tracking (clock in/out, breaks, IP logging), role-based access, payroll, document management.
7.  **Finance Module:** Vendor management, check printing, income/expense tracking, vendor invoices, financial reporting.
8.  **Security:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and JWT-based user authentication (login/logout).
9.  **UI/UX:** React dashboard with Tailwind CSS, Heroicons, cosmic/glass morphism theme, login page, professional interfaces.
10. **Dashboard Updates:** Transform existing patient/invoice/low stock shortcuts into eRx, Daily Total, Patient Queue, and Pending Payments views with associated lists.
11. **New Modules:** Patient Scheduling and Patient Communications modules (simple features).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, utilizing MongoDB as the database.



**Key Files and Their Importance & Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance:** Core backend logic, API endpoints, MongoDB models, business logic for all modules.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Implemented  and  models, password hashing, JWT token generation, and  routes for login/registration.
        -   Added  and  models for eRx, with corresponding API endpoints ().
        -   Resolved  model conflict by renaming original to  and updating references, using a separate collection () for eRx.
        -   Introduced new dashboard API endpoints for eRx, Daily Total, Patient Queue, and Pending Payments (, , , ).
        -   Enhanced Smart Forms API endpoints, likely adding functionalities for form submission and retrieval.
        -   Added placeholder API endpoints for Scheduling and Patient Communications.

-   :
    -   **Importance:** Main React component, application structure, routing, global context (), and houses most module UIs.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Integrated  and  for login/logout and protected routes.
        -   Fixed initial frontend compilation errors, likely related to syntax or missing imports around authentication.
        -   Integrated eRx functionality into the EHR module (within 's  part), adding a Prescriptions tab,  component, and related state/functions.
        -   Transformed the  component to display new operational cards instead of generic stats, including  for navigation and new view components (, , , ).
        -   Integrated Smart Forms module with enhanced UI components (builder, submission, viewer modals) and added a Forms tab to the EHR section within .
        -   Added placeholder entries for  and  modules in the dashboard navigation.
        -   Attempted to add  and  components, but they are currently referenced without full definition, causing runtime errors.
        -   Resolved duplicate function declarations for .

-   :
    -   **Importance:** Critical for tracking development progress, testing protocols, and results.
    -   **Changes Made:** Consistently updated with test plans, backend test results for authentication, eRx, new dashboard endpoints, and Smart Forms. Also recorded the resolution of previous invoice/inventory issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   Define and implement the  and  React components in .
-   Fully implement and test the backend API endpoints for the Scheduling and Patient Communications modules, as they are currently returning 404 errors.
-   Ensure proper date handling and encoding for all API responses, as backend logs showed date-related encoding errors.

<current_work>
The immediate work being done is the implementation of the patient scheduling and patient communications modules, as per the user's request.

**Backend Status:** The AI engineer previously added placeholder API endpoints for these modules. However, recent testing () and log checks (, ) indicate that these new endpoints are returning 404 Not Found errors. This suggests that while route definitions might exist, the underlying logic or proper registration of these routes within the FastAPI application is incomplete or incorrect. There were also observed backend encoding errors related to date objects.

**Frontend Status:** On the frontend, the  component has been updated to include navigation cards for Scheduling and Communications. However, when navigating to these modules, the application encounters runtime errors because the  and  components themselves are referenced in the  function in  but are not actually defined (, ). This prevents the application from rendering these views and indicates that the structural components for these modules are missing from the frontend codebase. The AI engineer's last action () was to add these missing components to .
