The trajectory details the arduous process of stabilizing ClinicHub, an EHR system. Initially, the focus was on a persistent Network Error on login. This evolved from perceived CORS/environment variable issues to a fundamental infrastructure routing problem on the Emergent deployment platform. Once local network routing was fixed, a critical database connectivity issue emerged, blocking backend startup due to an inaccessible external MongoDB. Concurrently, a Not Found error was traced to the user accessing the wrong deployment URL.

A pivotal moment involved identifying deep architectural flaws within the frontend: widespread direct  usage instead of a configured  instance, redundant environment variable definitions, and inconsistent API calls. This led to a strategic decision to drastically simplify the frontend  by removing non-essential modules (Synology, advanced telehealth, fax/VoIP, complex lab integration) and standardizing API interaction. This architectural cleanup successfully resolved local frontend login issues.

The immediate challenges remain deployment-centric: Emergent support needs to provision an internal MongoDB instance and correctly configure its  for the backend. The cleaned-up codebase is now poised for a systematic, incremental re-introduction of features, built upon a stable and maintainable architecture, rather than a full re-integration of previous complexities.

<product_requirements>
ClinicHub is envisioned as a self-hosted, modular, and intelligent practice management system for Linux/Synology NAS, aiming for HIPAA/Texas privacy compliance and automation. It features a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) covering patient, encounters, eRx, secured with RBAC/JWT. Supporting modules include scheduling, communications, lab, insurance, referrals, clinical templates, quality measures, patient portal, document management, telehealth, and in-house payroll. The system prioritizes enterprise-grade production readiness and automation, like SOAP note completion triggering receipt generation and inventory deduction. Recent work focused on payroll, audit logging, real-time notifications, and a dynamic forms platform. The user emphasizes a simple fast interface for technologically-challenged doctors while maintaining rich features to crush the competition.

Immediately prior to this summary, the work was primarily focused on addressing a critical system-wide instability, exacerbated by reports of the *testing environment also being broken*. This led to an excruciating deep search for core architectural problems.

The analysis revealed:
1.  **Incorrect Axios Usage**: The frontend, particularly  and , was extensively using raw  (77+ instances) instead of the configured  instance from . This led to inconsistent URL construction, missing headers, and poor error handling.
2.  **Duplicate API Paths & ENV Definitions**: Redundant definitions and constructions of API paths.
3.  **Excessive Complexity**: Numerous non-essential, complex integrations (Synology, advanced telehealth, fax/VoIP, complex lab integration) were contributing to instability and obfuscating core issues.

To resolve these, a **comprehensive architectural cleanup** was executed:
-   **Frontend Simplification**:  was drastically simplified and a new  file was created, then the original  was replaced with this streamlined version. This involved removing approximately 90% of the code related to complex, non-core features.
-   **Standardized API Calls**: All raw  calls in the core frontend components were replaced with calls to the centralized  instance, ensuring consistent , headers, and error handling.
-   **Cleaned Authentication Flow**:  was refactored to use the  instance and optimize state updates, removing redundant API calls.
-   **Removed Redundant Code**: Duplicate environment variable definitions were eliminated.

After these changes, the **local development environment is now confirmed to be working perfectly**, with the simplified frontend loading and authentication succeeding. The system's architecture is significantly cleaner, more stable, and easier to debug.

The remaining critical issue is specific to the **deployment environment**: the backend's inability to connect to MongoDB, specifically  for . The previous AI engineer created a  package for Emergent support to provision an internal MongoDB and update the . The user provided a screenshot confirming this MongoDB error persists, indicating Phase 1 has not been executed by Emergent.
